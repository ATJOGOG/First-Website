                <h2>Tien</h2>
                <p>Originally evil, (ironic for a zen person), Tien is a disciplined, reclusive and heavily devoted martial artist,
                    and one of the strongest Earthlings within the Dragon Ball universe. He also possesses a few non-human traits due to
                    being descended from the alien Triclops race.</p>

                    where he may be willing to train students who travel to his doorstep. He is also the originator of the Kamehameha Wave.</p>
